    // Implicit texture bundles
    // ========================
    // These allow you to implicitly associate an asset bundle with a path
    // prefix. Any texture that gets loaded through KSPTextureLoader will check
    // asset bundles listed for any of its directory prefixes.
    //
    // Doing this implicitly means that other downstream mods can continue to
    // use texture paths the same as they would if those textures were on disk.
    // This allows you to transparently switch to asset bundles without having
    // to worry about breaking backwards compatibility.
    //
    // You can declare an asset prefix by adding a new ImplicitBundle node
    // to the KSPTextureLoader node.
    //
    // Like this:
    //
    // @KSPTextureLoader
    // {
    //     ImplicitBundle
    //     {
    //         prefix = MyMod/Textures
    //         bundle = MyMod/my-mod-textures.unity3d
    //     }
    // }
    //
    // Any time a texture file is loaded within the MyMod/Textures directory it
    // will implicitly check the MyMod/my-mod-textures.unity3d asset bundle to
    // see if it contains a matching asset. You can safely declare multiple
    // bundles for a single directory if you are running into size limits.
    //
    // Each asset bundle needs to have a unique name, as otherwise unity will
    // prevent it from being loaded. Make sure to add mod name as a prefix to
    // the texture bundle name.
