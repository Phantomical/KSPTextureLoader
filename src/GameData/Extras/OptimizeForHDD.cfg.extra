// By default, KSPTextureLoader uses multiple threads to read files off disk.
// This works really well when KSP is on a SSD, but not so well when KSP is on
// a hard drive.
//
// This config changes things so that all disk reads are done on a single
// thread, which should improve performance on a HDD.
